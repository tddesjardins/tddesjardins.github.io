                          <h3>
                            I am currently working with the Data Management System in the Roman Science Operations Center to help define the Roman data format
                            for the Wide Field Instrument, as well as coordinating efforts to create example/test data for development and scientific validation
                            of the data pipeline.  The Data Management Division at STScI is in charge of the software development, and is planning to re-use as much
                            of the James Webb data pipeline as possible; however, there are some important differences between James Webb and Roman that necessitate
                            changes to both the pipeline and the reference files, and this is the focus of my work.

                            and delivery of the Roman SIAF, including making decisions regarding the user-facing coordinate systems and how they transform
                            to sky- and observatory-based frames.

                            I spearheaded development of a modernized pipeline for the creation of HST/ACS reference files.
                            This includes dark, bias, and sink pixel files used by the science calibration pipeline. This work was
                            done using Python 3 and a MySQL database server, along with a Flask-powered dashboard for generating
                            diagnostic reports.

                            I worked on recalibrating the ACS/WFC polarizing filters and updating inconsistencies in the documentation. I also took the initiative to develop
                            code in the <a href=https://github.com/spacetelescope/acstools">ACS Tools</a> Python package to simplify the calculation of polarization properties
                            measured from ACS photometry. With Dean Hines, I co-led the effort to investigate the possibility of using ACS as a spectropolarimeter.

                            noise history (and anomalies) of the detectors, and adivising on the efficacy of the monthly CCD annealing program.

                            on the James Webb Space Telescope. I was also heavily involved in modernizing the Hubble documentation to the <a href="https://hst-docs.stsci.edu">HDox</a>
                            documentation system, while further updating many aspects of the HST and ACS Data Handbooks to remove out of date information (e.g., IRAF). I also initially
                            organized development of Jupyter notebooks as examples of ACS data calibration/analysis and assisted in the development of notebooks for AstroDrizzle.

  							<p>My science background focuses on extragalactic observational astronomy, and I have
                  mainly used X-ray imaging spectroscopy and optical imaging data. I have extensive experience

                  on the Hubble Space Telescope, as well as the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) instrument on
                  the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and several ground-based observing facilities.

                            Supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies are the most powerful persistent sources of energy in the Universe.
                            Using multi-wavelength observations, we can begin to untangle their mysteries and peer into the engines in the hearts of galaxies.
                            As an undergraduate, I examined optical SDSS AGN variability and its relationship with black hole mass calculated from SDSS spectroscopy.
                            In my Ph.D. thesis, I also identified AGN candidates in the Coma Cluster using X-ray, optical, infrared, and radio selection criteria.

                          <h3>
                            The environments of galaxies have a significant impact on their evolution, from galactic canabalism to major mergers with nearby
                            companions to ram pressure stripping in cluster halos. The effects of these processes over cosmic time shape our view of the nearby Universe,
                            and understanding them is key to understanding both the past and future of galaxies. In my Ph.D. thesis, I examined the diffuse X-ray emission
                            around and between galaxies in compact groups. As a postdoc, I generated photometric catalogs of galaxies in the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS)
                            using multiple ground-based observatories.

  											<h4>X-ray Binaries</h4>
                          <h3>
                            X-ray binaries consist of a star and a compact object in a system. Relationships have been observed between
                            population of X-ray binaries in galaxies and the galaxy stellar mass (low-mass binaries) as well as the
                            star formation rate (high mass binaries). As a masters student, I examined these relationships in nearby, face-on spiral galaxies
                            using Chandra ACIS and Hubble ACS observations to search for probable optical counterparts to X-ray point sources. This helped to
                            disentangle the low- and high-mass X-ray binary populations for a more accurate analysis of these scaling relationships in other galaxies.

							</header>

							<p>
                I am originally from central Florida, but have lived up and down the U.S. east coast.
                I also lived in Ontario, Canada, where I did my Ph.D. and in Lawrence, Kansas as a postdoc.
                In 2017, I brought my orange kitty Catsby along with me as we headed back east to Baltimore, Maryland.
                We've settled down in a house in the northeast corner of the city, where I've spent my pandemic
                isolation developing my new gardening hobby. I have recently been growing plants from seed,
                planting up lots of containers, setting up an irrigation system, and making plans for more
                landscaping over the next couple years.

                        I found this little fluffball in 2015 at the <a href="https://lawrencehumane.org/">Lawrence Human Society</a>
                        in Lawrence, Kansas. She was in pretty rough shape, and just a year old. They named her The Great Catsby, and I thought that it
                        was so cute that I kept it. We've been best friends ever since,
                        and she loves everyone she meets.

                        Since buying my first home, I've become a fan of gardening. I love learning about lots of different
                        kinds of plants and trying to grow them. Some are fussy, some are easy, and they all have interesting temperments.
                        This is an example of a container I planted up in Spring 2021 with snap dragons, bacopa, and heuchera, which is
                        starting to take over a bit!

                        For the last several years, I've become an avid video gamer and even stream on Twitch occasionally.
                        I mostly play role playing games such as Final Fantasy XIV, Subnautica, and Divinity Original Sin, with
                        the occasional 4X game like Civilization mixed in.
